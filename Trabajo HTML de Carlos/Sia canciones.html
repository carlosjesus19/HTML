    Letras:

    All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
    I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
    Oh yeah
    Oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
    Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
    It's never the right time
    Yeah, yeah
    I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
    I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
    I'm unstoppable
    I'm a Porsche with no brakes
    I'm invincible
    Yeah, I win every single game
    I'm so powerful
    I don't need batteries to play
    I'm so confident
    Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    I'm unstoppable today
    Break down, only alone I will cry on out
    You'll never see what's hiding out
    Hiding out deep down
    Yeah, yeah
    I know, I've heard that to let your feelings go
    Is the only way to make friendships grow
    But I'm too afraid now
    Yeah, yeah
    I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
    I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
    I'm unstoppable
    I'm a Porsche with no breaks
    I'm invincible
    Yeah, I win every single game
    I'm so powerful
    I don't need batteries to play
    I'm so confident
    Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    I'm unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    Unstoppable today
    I'm unstoppable today
    I put my arm around, show you how strong I am
    I put my arm around, I'll show you that I am
    I'm unstoppable
    I'm a Porsche with no breaks
    I'm invincible
    Yeah, I win every single game

    Letras:

    Party girls don't get hurt
    Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
    I push it down, push it down
    I'm the one "for a good time call"
    Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
    I feel the love, feel the love
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
    I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
    From the chandelier
    I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
    Like it doesn't exist
    I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
    Feel my tears as they dry
    I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
    From the chandelier
    But I'm holding on for dear life
    Won't look down, won't open my eyes
    Keep my glass full until morning light
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
    Won't look down, won't open my eyes
    Keep my glass full until morning light
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight
    Sun is up, I'm a mess
    Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
    Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
    Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
    I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
    From the chandelier
    I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
    Like it doesn't exist
    I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
    Feel my tears as they dry
    I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
    From the chandelier
    But I'm holding on for dear life
    Won't look down, won't open my eyes
    Keep my glass full until morning light
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
    Won't look down, won't open my eyes
    Keep my glass full until morning light
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    On for tonight, on for tonight
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
    On for tonight, on for tonight
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
    Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
    On for tonight, on for tonight

    Alive

    Letras:

    I was born in a thunderstorm
    I grew up overnight
    I played alone
    I played on my own
    I survived
    Hey
    I wanted everything I never had
    Like the love that comes with light
    I wore envy and I hated that
    But I survived
    I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
    Where the wind don't change
    And nothing in the ground can ever grow
    No hope, just lies
    And you're taught to cry into your pillow
    But I survived
    I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I found solace in the strangest place
    Way in the back of my mind
    I saw my life in a stranger's face
    And it was mine
    I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
    Where the wind don't change
    And nothing in the ground can ever grow
    No hope, just lies
    And you're taught to cry into your pillow
    But I survived
    I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    You took it all, but I'm still breathing
    I have made every single mistake
    That you could ever possibly make
    I took and I took and I took what you gave
    But you never noticed that I was in pain
    I knew what I wanted, I went in and got it
    Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
    I told you that I would never be forgotten
    And all in spite of you
    And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
    I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive
    I'm alive

        Never give up

    Letras:

    I've battled demons that won't let me sleep
    Called to the sea but she abandoned me
    But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
    No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
    And I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    Oh yeah, I'm haunted by the distant past
    Called to the skies but she was she overcast
    But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
    No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
    And I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    Never give up, never give up
    Never give up, never give up
    No, no, oooh
    And I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I won't let you get me down
    I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
    Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
    I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

    Helium

    Letras:

    I'm trying but I keep falling down
    I cry out but nothing comes now
    I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
    I never wanted to need someone
    Yeah, I wanted to play tough
    Thought I could do all just on my own
    But even Superwoman
    Sometimes needed Superman's soul
    Help me out of this hell
    Your love lifts me up like helium
    Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
    When I've hit the ground
    You're all I need
    'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
    And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
    I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
    But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
    I am lucky that you're around
    Yeah, I wanted to play tough
    Thought I could do all just on my own
    But even Superwoman
    Sometimes needed Superman's soul
    Help me out of this hell
    Your love lifts me up like helium
    Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
    When I've hit the ground
    You're all I need
    'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
    Lifts me up like helium
    You lift me up and I am found
    You lift me up before I hit the ground
    You lift me up when I am down down down
    You lift me up before I hit the ground
    You lift me up when I'm down down down
    You lift me up before I hit the ground
    Your love lifts me up like helium
    Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
    When I've hit the ground
    You're all I need
    'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
    Your love lifts me up like helium
