    Umbrella

    Letras:

    Uh huh, uh huh
    Yeah, Rihanna
    Uh huh, uh huh
    Good girl gone bad
    Uh huh, uh huh
    Take three, action
    Uh huh, uh huh, Hov
    No clouds in my stones
    Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
    Comin' down at the Dow Jones
    When the clouds come, we gone
    We Rocafella
    We fly higher than weather
    In G5s or better
    You know me
    In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
    Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
    Rihanna, where you at?
    You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
    Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
    Baby, 'cause in the dark
    You can't see shiny cars
    And that's when you need me there
    With you I'll always share
    Because
    When the sun shines, we'll shine together
    Told you I'll be here forever
    Said I'll always be your friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
    These fancy things will never come in between
    You're part of my entity, here for infinity
    When the world has took its part
    When the world has dealt its cards
    If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
    Because
    When the sun shines, we shine together
    Told you I'll be here forever
    Said I'll always be your friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
    You can run into my arms
    It's okay, don't be alarmed
    Come into me
    (There's no distance in between our love)
    So gon' and let the rain pour
    I'll be all you need and more
    Because
    When the sun shines, we shine together
    Told you I'll be here forever
    Said I'll always be your friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
    It's raining, raining
    Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
    Baby, come into me
    Come into me
    It's raining, raining
    Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
    You can always come into me
    Come into me
    It's pouring rain
    It's pouring rain
    Come into me
    Come into me
    It's pouring rain
    It's pouring rain

    We found love

    Letras:

    Yellow diamonds in the light
    Now we're standing side by side
    As your shadow crosses mine
    What it takes to come alive
    It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
    But I've gotta let it go
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    Shine a light through an open door
    Love and life I will divide
    Turn away 'cause I need you more
    Feel the heartbeat in my mind
    It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
    But I've gotta let it go
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    Yellow diamonds in the light
    Now we're standing side by side
    As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place
    We found love in a hopeless place

    Give it to me on a daily

    Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
    You say I'm the one you want, so come express it
    Don't slip, don't slip
    'Cause a nigga might push up on it
    Don't really wanna lose this moment
    Why window shop when you own this?
    (Ah-ah-ah) don't put it down

    I'm searching for my soul (rockstar)
    Whoever turned you cold (peep this)
    You need to let him know
    I can work miracles
    I'll work it physical (physical)
    And when I hold you close
    You can hear my heart beating from my clothes (oh, woah)
    Future
    I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
    I need love and affection

    Stay

    Letras:

    All along it was a fever
    A cold sweat, hot headed believer
    I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
    He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
    Round and around and around and around we go
    Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay
    It's not much of a life you're living
    It's not just something you take, it's given
    Round and around and around and around we go
    Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    And I want you to stay
    Ooh, the reason I hold on
    Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
    Well, funny you're the broken one
    But I'm the only one who needed saving
    'Cause when you never see the light
    It's hard to know which one of us is caving
    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay
    Stay
    I want you to stay
    Ooh
